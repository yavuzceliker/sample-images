# Sample Images Collection

This repo contains 700 sample images that you can use for web design, testing, learning or fun purposes.

## How to Use

Each image has a link structure like https://yavuzceliker.github.io/sample-images/image-n.jpg. Here, n is a number between 1 and 700. You can change the n value in the link to view the image you want.

For example, if you click on the link https://yavuzceliker.github.io/sample-images/image-1.jpg, you will see the following image:
